Favorites menu module for webtrees
==================================

Description
------------
This exposes the Webtrees Favorites list as a menu item. This menu item is displayed on entries that can be 
marked as favorites including individuals, families and media. It is possible to toggle the status from 
the menu.

Note, the title and note fields are blank when setting an item as a favorite unlike the menu version
from the Favorites block that allows these fields to be edited.  

Installation & upgrading
------------------------
Download and unpack the zip file and place the folder favorites-menu in the modules_v4 folder of webtrees. Upload the newly added folder to your server. It is activated by default. Go to the control panel, click in the module section on 'Menus' where you can find the newly added menu item. You can move it up or down to change the order. Click on the tools icon next to the title of the newly added menu item. This will open the settings page where you can set a menu title and add the page title and text.

This is a simple module and provided as is. However, if you experience any bugs you can create a new issue on GitHub.
